ChartreuseCoin (CHA)

ChartreuseCoin is an innovative, secure and energy efficient PoW/PoS coin that is better than BlueCoin. It uses a faster PoW distribution mechanism to distribute the initial coins, then after 100 days the coin is basically transferred to a pure PoS coin, where the generation of the coin is mainly through the PoS interests or something.
